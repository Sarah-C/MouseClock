# Mouse Analogue Clock
A Win 10/11 mouse following analogue clock for when the taskbar's hidden.


**Doesn't clutter your Desktop**              
The clock doesn't get in the way, it's semi-transparent and it does NOT appear in the Taskbar, or the System Tray, or even the Alt + Tab program select window!


**To close the clock**                        
Move your mouse pointer to the top of your screens and simply right click. The program will instantly close.


**Action shot**                                   
Here's a picture of the clock just over the Visual Studio Desktop icon - showing off the transparency. (I added a hand drawn pointer for the screenshot!)
Next to it is a close up of the anti-aliased Material Design clock face.

**DesktopClock.exe** is the file you need, everything else is for Visual Studio 2022, so you can tweek and build it yourself.


**Cutting edge Windows styling**
Using advanced Win32 features to create a DPI scaling aware, real-time semi transparent, shadow enabled and custom shaped headerless Window, the clock keeps perfect time with the system and smoothly follows the mouse pointer around without any stuttering. A useful and unobtrusive Windows gadget for the modern system!

This is an old VB.Net program I wrote that I recently updated to C# / VS 2022. The process was surprisingly straight forward!
