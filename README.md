# Mouse Analogue Clock
A Win 10/11 mouse following analogue clock for when the taskbar's hidden.


**Doesn't clutter your Desktop**              
The clock doesn't get in the way, it's semi-transparent and it does NOT appear in the Taskbar, or the System Tray, or even the Alt + Tab program select window!


**To close the clock**                        
Move your mouse button to the top of your screens and simply right click. The program will instantly close.


**Action shot**                                   
The mouse cursor is your own, I didn't have a "mouse in the image" screen capturer installed when I did this piccy...
Nice hand drawn mouse pointer eh?
